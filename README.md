__What's this?__

This repository was based off the work of the Fundamalleus Organization to catch Apocalypse up to 9th edition. Certain datasheets felt very behind if you current played (slow thousand sons, daemon engines hitting on 4s, force orgs not matching up at all, firstborn marines still having 1W, etc). It's a GitHub repository of datafiles. It extends [Warhammer 40,000 Fundapocalypse](https://github.com/normanthesquid/wh40k-fundapocalypse) and adds missing datasheets and rules from recent releases

__Okay, nice project. Is it actually working?__ _I just want those files..._

Yes! The files should be downloadable directly through github

Data Url:
https://github.com/th3proj3ct/wh40k-apocalypse-9e/releases/download/v1.0/index.bsi

On PC you go Manage Data (three rectangles) -> Import Data -> Import Data from URL -> use our data URL.

On Mobile go Manage Data (three rectangles) -> 3 dots -> Add data index url -> use our data URL.
